<h1>Choosing an App Type</h1>

<p>
Sometimes it's hard to decide whether you need to publish a
<a href="hosted_apps">hosted app</a> or a
<a href="/apps/">Chrome App</a>&mdash;or
maybe even an
<a href="/extensions/">Chrome Extension</a>.
This page aims to help you choose the right type of app.
</p>

<h2 id="flow"> Overview </h2>

<p>
As the following figure shows,
if you already have a web app,
you don't need to change it;
you can just publish it as a hosted app.
If you're willing to modify your app
or build one from scratch,
you have more options.

<h2 id="details"> Details </h2>

<p>
If you're having trouble deciding what type of app to create, read the article
<a href="apps_vs_extensions.html">Extensions, Packaged Apps, and Hosted Apps in the Chrome Web Store</a>.
Here's some additional information to help you choose:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> A <b>hosted</b> app can work in all web browsers,
    as long as it doesn't depend on features
    that not all browsers support yet, such as
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome/apps/docs/background">background execution</a>
    or <a href="http://www.khronos.org/webgl/">WebGL</a>.
    On the other hand,
    because only Chrome supports the Chrome Web Store,
    you have the option of tailoring your app to Chrome.
  <li> Only an <b>extension</b> can present an icon in the toolbar,
    using a
    <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/browserAction.html">page action</a> or
    <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/browserAction.html">browser action</a>. </li>
  <li>
    Although an <b>extension</b> has little to no UI of its own,
    it can sometimes have a big effect on the UI of other pages and web apps.
    For example, an extension can
    <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/override.html">replace
    a standard Chrome page</a>, such as the History page (chrome://history).
    Or it can change the contents or formatting of some or all websites&mdash;to
    use different fonts, for example.
    </li>
  <li> The <a href="check_for_payment.html">Licensing API</a>
    lets you check programmatically
    whether the user has paid for your app
    using Chrome Web Store Payments.
    The Licensing API is usually used only by <b>hosted</b> apps
    because packaged apps are stored locally and
    <a href="faq.html#faq-app-02">could be modified</a>
    to circumvent the API call. </li>
  <li> The <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/api_index.html">chrome.* APIs</a>
    let your <b>extension</b>
    be tightly integrated with Chrome.
    They take advantage of Chrome support for functionality such as
    <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/idle.html">idle state</a>,
    <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/i18n.html">internationalization</a>,
    <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/tabs.html">tabs</a>, and
    <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/windows.html">windows</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
