<h1 class="page-title">Distributing Products Built for Chrome</h1>

<p>On Chrome, you can build and distribute the following kinds of products:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Websites</th>
        <td>With just an extra bit of metadata, you can integrate your website into the Chrome browser, making your content more accessible to users.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Extensions</th>
        <td><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/overview">Extensions</a> are small browser add-ons that add new and useful features to Chrome.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Chrome Apps</th>
        <td><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps">Chrome apps</a> are designed specifically for Chrome and only work in the Chrome browser. They allow you to take advantage of cutting-edge technology that is not available to traditional websites.
          <p class="caution">
            <b>Important:</b>
            Chrome will be removing support for Chrome Apps on Windows, Mac, and
            Linux.  Chrome OS will continue to support Chrome Apps.

          </p>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Themes</th>
        <td><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/themes">Themes</a> change the way the Chrome browser looks, adding style to your usersâ€™ browsing experience.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2 id="distribution-options">Distribution Options </h2>

<p>While the Chrome Web Store is the primary hub for distributing Chrome products, several other distribution options are available.</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Chrome Web Store</th>
        <td>The <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">Chrome Web Store</a> is an online marketplace where users can browse for Chrome-integrated websites, Chrome apps, extensions, and themes. The store helps users find, purchase, and install your content in the Chrome browser.
        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: Chrome supports <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/native-client/devguide/distributing">Native Client (NaCl) and Portable Native Client (PNaCl)</a> technologies. Products using NaCl must be distributed through the Chrome Web Store.</p>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>External Installation</th>
        <td>In certain cases,  you might want your product to be installed automatically. <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/external_extensions">External installation</a> allows you to do this.</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
     	<th>Mobile</th>
        <td>For mobile users, you can easily <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/apps/chrome_apps_on_mobile">convert your products</a> into native apps for Android and iOS using <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/">Apache Cordova</a>.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2 id="monetization-options">Monetization Options </h2>

<p>The Chrome platform supports a variety of <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/money">payment systems and monetization models</a>. Chrome Web Store Payments powered by Google Wallet for Digital Goods is especially well-integrated with the store. Alternatively, you are free to choose whichever payment service provider you prefer.</p>
<p>The following table covers a few ways to monetize your product.</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Freemium</th>
        <td>A free trial version of your product that prompts users for payment to unlock advanced features or regain access after a time-limit.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>One-time Payment</th>
        <td>Users buy your product by providing a one-time payment upfront.
        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: This is the only monetization option for themes.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Subscription</th>
        <td>Users purchase access to your product on a subscription basis.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Custom</th>
        <td>You are  free to implement a custom model that works best for you. For in-app payments, consider using the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/payments-iap">Chrome Web Store API</a>.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
