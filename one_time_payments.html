<h1>One-Time Payments</h1>

<p>
    If you choose to charge users for your Chrome App, Chrome Extension or Chrome Theme
    in the Chrome Web Store, there are several options available to you.
    The Chrome Web Store has a built-in one-time payment system called
    Chrome Web Store Payments.
</p>

<p>
    Alternatively for Chrome Apps, you have the option of
    selling virtual goods using the
    <a href="/apps/google_wallet.html">Google Wallet</a> in Chrome along with
    the
    Chrome Web Store API.
</p>

<h3 id="offering-free-trial">Offering a free trial</h3>
<p>
    For Chrome Apps or hosted web apps, you can provide a free trial
    version that either gives the user full access for a limited period of
    time or restricts which features are available. You can enable the free
    trial by checking the appropriate box in the Developer Dashboard, then
    using the Licensing API to confirm what kind of license the user has and
    how long they've had it, with an upgrade path to the paid version.
</p>

<p class="note">
    <b>Note</b>: Free trial capabilities are not available for Themes.
</p>

<h3 id="cws-licensing-api">Chrome Web Store Licensing API</h3>
<p>
    You can use the Chrome Web Store Licensing API to determine whether the
    user has paid for your item or how long they've been using their free
    trial. The Licensing API is a simple REST-based API that lets you query
    the Chrome Web Store license server to find out whether a particular user
    is using a free trial or if they have paid for your item.
</p>

<h2 id="before-starting">Before you get started</h2>
<p>
    The Chrome Web Store handles the transaction using Google Wallet to
    complete the transaction with the user. If you don't have one already,
    you must open a Google Wallet Merchant account, and associate that account
    with the store. For details, see
    <a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome_webstore/bin/answer.py?answer=96832">
        Register for a Google Wallet Merchant account</a>.
</p>

<p class="note">
    <b>Note</b>: See <a
        href="/webstore/pricing#seller">Payments: Regions,
    fees and tiers</a> for more information about fees and locations where
    you can sell your app.
</p>

<h2 id="using-otps">Using one-time payments</h2>
<p>
    You can set up the one-time payment and offer a free trial option on the
    listing page of the
    <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard">Chrome
        Web Store Developer Dashboard</a>. The Chrome Web Store manages the
    licenses for each user and exposes that information through a REST API.
</p>

<p>
    To enable one-time payments:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Choose and set the price in the Chrome Web Store listing.
    </li>
    <li>
        Enable the Chrome Web Store API in the
        <a href="https://cloud.google.com/console">Google APIs Console</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Update the <code>manifest.json</code> to add the
        <a href="#update-manifest">necessary scope and permission</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add code to your app to verify the license.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="verifying-payment">Verifying payment and offering free trial</h2>
<p>
    To verify if the user has a license, you can query the Chrome Web Store
    Licensing API.
</p>

<p>
    Here's an overview of the process required to use the licensing API
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Get the identity token for the current user.</li>
    <li>Make an authenticated request to the licensing server.</li>
    <li>Verify the response.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="update-manifest">Update the manifest.json</h3>
<p>
    Before you can use the licensing API, you'll need to modify the
    <code>manifest.json</code> file and add a new scope and potentially a new
    permission.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        If you haven't already, enable the Chrome Identity API, see
        <a href="/apps/app_identity.html">User
            Authentication</a> for more information.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you haven't already, enable the Chrome Web Store API in the
        <a href="https://code.google.com/apis/console">Google APIs Console</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the <code>manifest.json</code> file:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Add <code>https://www.googleapis.com/</code> to the
                <code>permissions</code> section.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add
                <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chromewebstore.readonly</code>
                to the <code>scopes</code> subsection of the <code>oauth2</code>
                section.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">{
  "permissions": [
    "storage",
    "identity",
    <strong>"https://www.googleapis.com/"</strong>
  ],
  "oauth2": {
    "client_id": "665859454684-s6nmohpktccl2srxvc67thbmpclpa36v.apps.googleusercontent.com",
    "scopes": [
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.login",
      <strong>"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chromewebstore.readonly"</strong>
    ]
  }
}</pre>

<h3 id="verify-code">Verifying the license</h3>
<p>
    To verify the user has purchased your Chrome App, Extension or hosted web
    app, or if they are using a free trial experience:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Get the current users authentication token using
        <code>chrome.identity.getAuthToken()</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make an XHR with the users access token and your app ID to
        <code>https://www.googleapis.com/chromewebstore/v1.1/userlicenses/&lt;YOUR_APP_ID&gt;</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Parse the JSON response, verify the license and store the result.
    </li>
</ol>

<pre>var CWS_LICENSE_API_URL = 'https://www.googleapis.com/chromewebstore/v1.1/userlicenses/';
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.open('GET', CWS_LICENSE_API_URL + chrome.runtime.id);
req.setRequestHeader('Authorization', 'Bearer ' + token);
req.onreadystatechange = function() {
  if (req.readyState == 4) {
    var license = JSON.parse(req.responseText);
    verifyAndSaveLicense(license);
  }
}
req.send();</pre>

<p class="note">
<b>Note</b>: You cannot offer free trial experiences for Themes because
themes do not execute any JavaScript and cannot verify a license.
</p>

<h3 id="parse-response">Handling and parsing the response</h3>
<p>
    The response you get from the license server tells you three things:
    whether the user has access, the level of access the user
    should have, and how much longer the response is valid. If you just want
    to know whether the user has access, check the value of the
    <code>result</code> field. If you want to know whether the user should
    get a free trial version, check the value of the
    <code>accessLevel</code> field.
</p>

<p>Sample JSON license object</p>
<pre>{
  "kind": "chromewebstore#license",
  "itemId": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
  "createdTime": "1377660091254",
  "result": true,
  "accessLevel": "FULL",
  "maxAgeSecs": "2052"
}</pre>

            timestamp. You can use to limit functionality of a free trial to
            a specific period of time.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>result</td>
        <td>
            Whether the user has a license (full or trial),
            <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>accessLevel</td>
        <td>
            <code>FREE_TRIAL</code>, <code>FULL</code> or <code>NONE</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>maxAgeSecs</td>
        <td>
            The length of time the response is valid for, once that time
            has passed your app should query the license server again to
            check whether the user's access has changed.
        </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
</p>

<h3 id="cache-response">Caching the response</h3>

<p>
    To improve the performance and avoid running into rate limits,
    you should cache the license data locally using the
    <code><a href="/apps/storage.html">
        chrome.storage.sync</a></code> API and only refresh it on a periodic
    basis.
    By storing the license data in the sync data, it will be synced across all
    machines that the users is logged into.
</p>

<p>
    In addition, do not block the user interface or lock the user out of your
    Chrome App or Extension while waiting for the licensing server to respond,
    but instead, allow the user to continue for a limited grace period until a
    response is received. Providing a grace period of at least a day or two
    will ensure that your Chrome App or Extension continues to work properly in
    an offline situation where the user may not be connected to the network.
</p>

<p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h2 id="handling-trial">Handling the free trial experience</h2>
<p>
    If you decide to offer a free trial to users, there are several ways that
    you can allow users to try before they make the purchase. The two
    most common ways are providing full access for a limited time, or offering
    a limited feature set. Of course, you can also combine these two, or
    provide your own incentives to encourage users to upgrade to the paid
    version.
</p>

<h3 id="trial-limited-time">Limited time access</h3>
<p>
    The license API makes it easy to provide a limited time trial experience by
    including the date the license was first issued to the user. Comparing the
    <code>createdDate</code> to the current date will tell you how long the
    user has been using the free trial.
</p>

<pre>var licenseStatus;
if (license.result &amp;&amp; license.accessLevel == "FULL") {
  console.log("Fully paid &amp; properly licensed.");
  licenseStatus = "FULL";
} else if (license.result &amp;&amp; license.accessLevel == "FREE_TRIAL") {
  var daysAgoLicenseIssued = Date.now() - parseInt(license.createdTime, 10);
  daysAgoLicenseIssued = daysAgoLicenseIssued / 1000 / 60 / 60 / 24;
  if (daysAgoLicenseIssued &lt;= TRIAL_PERIOD_DAYS) {
    console.log("Free trial, still within trial period");
    licenseStatus = "FREE_TRIAL";
  } else {
    console.log("Free trial, trial period expired.");
    licenseStatus = "FREE_TRIAL_EXPIRED";
  }
} else {
  console.log("No license ever issued.");
  licenseStatus = "NONE";
}</pre>

<p class="note">
    <b>Note</b>: After major updates or a significant period of time,
    you may want to allow the user to try your item again so they can try the
    new features and see how the item has changed.
</p>

<h3 id="trial-limited-feature">Limited feature set</h3>
<p>
    Another way that you can provide a free trial to users is by offering
    them a limited feature set until they've upgraded to the paid version.
    For example, you might limit the number of files open at any given time,
    or the total number of files that the user can edit before being prompted
    for payment.
</p>

<h2 id="free2paid">Migrating from a free to a paid experience</h2>
<p>
    If you decide to migrate from a free experience to a paid experience, you
    should consider what experience you want to provide for any user who
    installed your item prior to the change. We strongly recommend
    grandfathering these users into the full, paid experience though the
    decision is yours.
</p>

<p>
    Users who installed your item prior to the change will have a
    <code>FREE_TRIAL</code> license. To determine if a user installed your
    item prior to the price change, you can check the <code>createdTime</code>
    value in the license to determine when they first installed it.
</p>
