  <b>Important:</b>
  Chrome will be removing support for Chrome Apps on Windows, Mac, and
  Linux.  Chrome OS will continue to support Chrome Apps.  Additionally,
  Chrome and the Web Store will continue to support extensions on all
  platforms.

<h1>Supplying Images</h1>

<p>
You need to supply several kinds of images
to be used in the Chrome Web Store
and the Google Chrome browser:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> <a href="#icons">App icon</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="#promo">Promotional images</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="#screenshots">Screenshots</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>
Only the app icon,
a small promotional image,
and a screenshot are mandatory.
However, providing attractive versions
of both required and optional images
increases your app's chances of getting noticed.
For example, your app can't be featured
unless you provide a large or marquee promotional image.
</p>

<h2 id="icons"> App icon </h2>

<p>
You must provide a 128x128-pixel app icon image in the
<a href="publish.html#step2">ZIP file of your app</a>.
Some requirements for the image:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> The actual icon size should be <b>96x96</b> (for square icons);
    an additional 16 pixels per side
    should be transparent padding,
    adding up to 128x128 total image size.
    For details, see <a href="#iconsize">Icon size</a>. </li>
  <li> The image must be in PNG format. </li>
  <li> The image should work well on both light and dark backgrounds. </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Since Chrome 15, the image that you provide is dynamically resized in the
    New Tab page. Its size is determined by the overall browser window size.
</p>

<p class="note">
<b>Note</b>:
To make sure your icon looks good,
preview your app's listing in the Chrome Web Store.
If you're working on an installable web app,
you also need to view your icon in the New Tab page.
To do so, you can
<a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome/apps/docs/developers_guide#installing">load the unpacked app</a>,
bring up the New Tab page,
and then look at the icon against a variety of backgrounds
by applying a few
<a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/">themes</a>.
</p>

<p>
When you design the icon,
keep the following advice in mind:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Don't put an edge around the 128x128 image;
    the UI might add edges. </li>
  <li> If your icon is mostly dark,
    consider adding a subtle white outer glow
    so it'll look good against dark backgrounds. </li>
  <li> Avoid large drop shadows;
    the UI might add shadows.
    It's OK to use small shadows for contrast. </li>
  <li> If you have a bevel at the bottom of your icon,
    we recommend 4 pixels of depth. </li>
  <li> Make the icon face the viewer,
    rather than having built-in perspective.
    See <a href="#perspective">Perspective</a> for details. </li>
</ul>

<p>
Here are some icons that follow these guidelines.
</p>

<p>
<a href="images/calendar.png"><img src="images/calendar.png"
    width="128" height="128"
    class="noborder"
    alt="Google Calendar icon (square)" /></a>
<a href="images/reader.png"><img src="images/reader.png"
    width="128" height="128"
    class="noborder"
    alt="Google Reader icon (irregular)" /></a>
<a href="images/mysteryicon.png"><img src="images/mysteryicon.png"
    width="128" height="128"
    class="noborder"
    alt="bowling ball-like icon (round)" /></a>
</p>

<p class="note">
<b>Note</b>:
If you upload an image that has no alpha,
it will be placed in a frame with rounded corners
(12-pixel corner radius).
</p>


<h3 id="iconsize">Icon size</h3>

<p>
All app icons should have the same visual weight,
occupying roughly the same area.
As the following figure shows,
when you size an icon to fill the available area,
square and circular icons are significantly larger
than they should be,
compared to icons with other shapes.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/visual_weight_1.png"
    width="562" height="98"
    class="noborder"
    alt="icons filling all available space" />
</p>

<p>
Normalizing the icon sizes,
as the next figure shows,
gives the icons roughly even area and visual weight.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/visual_weight_2.png"
    width="563" height="99"
    class="noborder"
    alt="most of the icons are smaller, and they have equal visual weight" />
</p>

<p>
You can use the following template images
to help you judge how large your image's artwork should be.
The templates show the correct size for a square and a circle,
but these are merely guides;
icons that have pointy bits might stray outside these areas.
If an irregularly shaped icon takes up very little area
and is mostly negative space,
using the entire 128x128 area might be acceptable.
</p>

<table class="columns">
<tr>
  <td style="text-align:center"> <a href="images/128-square.png"><img src="images/128-square.png"
    width="128" height="128"
    class="noborder"
    alt="square template" /></a></td>
  <td style="text-align:center"> <a href="images/128-circle.png"><img src="images/128-circle.png"
    width="128" height="128"
    class="noborder"
    alt="circle template" /></a></td>
  <td style="text-align:center"> <a href="images/128-irregular.png"><img src="images/128-irregular.png"
    width="128" height="128"
    class="noborder"
    alt="irregular template" /></a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="text-align:center"> <b>Template for square icons</b> </td>
  <td style="text-align:center"> <b>Template for circular icons</b> </td>
  <td style="text-align:center"> <b>Template for irregular icons</b> </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
You can follow some rules of thumb for artwork size.
For a square icon, make the artwork 96x96 pixels.
For other icons that are squarish,
make the artwork's width 75-80% of the total width of the image.
A circular icon should have a diameter of approximately 112 pixels,
or 85% to 90% of the image width.
Icons with irregular shapes should have similar weights.
</p>

<p>
The following figures show square and circular icons,
comparing them with the templates.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/128-square.png"
    width="128" height="128"
    class="noborder"
    alt="square template" />
<img src="images/calendar_bounded.png"
  width="128" height="128"
  class="noborder"
  alt="Google Calendar icon on top of square template" />
<img src="images/calendar.png"
  width="128" height="128"
  class="noborder"
  alt="Google Calendar icon" />
<br />
<img src="images/128-circle.png"
    width="128" height="128"
    class="noborder"
    alt="circle template" />
<img src="images/mysteryicon_bounded.png"
    width="128" height="128"
    class="noborder"
    alt="bowling ball-like icon on top of circle template" />
<img src="images/mysteryicon.png"
    width="128" height="128"
    class="noborder"
    alt="bowling ball-like icon" />
</p>

<p>
Here's an example of an irregularly shaped icon.
In this case, the icon follows neither the square nor circular guidelines,
but it fits near them both.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/128-irregular.png"
    width="128" height="128"
    class="noborder"
    alt="irregular template" /></a></td>
<img src="images/reader_bounded.png"
  width="128" height="128"
  class="noborder"
  alt="Google Reader icon on top of irregular template" />
<img src="images/reader.png"
  width="128" height="128"
  class="noborder"
  alt="Google Reader icon on top of irregular template" />
</p>


<h3 id="perspective">Perspective</h3>

<p>
For flexibility and consistency, app icons should be front-facing.
Subtle tweaks of perspective that give a sense of tangibility are OK,
but avoid dramatic angles.

<section id="newpromo">
<h2 id="promo"> Promotional images </h2>

<p>
You must provide one small, 440x280-pixel promotional image.
You can also provide other images
that the store can use to promote your app.
</p>

<p class="note">
<b>Note</b>:
Unlike <a href="#screenshots">screenshots</a>,
promotional images are not currently locale-specific.
If your app supports multiple locales,
we recommend either avoiding text by focusing on
graphical representations of the app's capabilities,
or targeting the promo images to
the locale in which you have the most users.
</p>

<p class="caution">
<b>Note</b>:
If your images refer to Google brands, follow the
<a href="branding.html">Branding Guidelines</a>.
</p>

<p>
Although only a small promotional image is required,
you can also supply larger promotional images
if you'd like your app to be featured more prominently
in the Chrome Web Store.
You can provide one of each of the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Small: 440x280 pixels <strong>(required)</strong> </li>
  <li> Large: 920x680 pixels </li>
  <li> Marquee: 1400x560 pixels </li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
<b>Note</b>:
Apps that don't have a small promotional image
will be shown <b>after</b> apps that do have that image.
If your app was published before the small promotional image was required,
you should add that image
so your app can be displayed more prominently.
</p>

<p>
Promotional images are your chance to capture users' attention
and entice them to learn more.
Don't just use a screenshot;
your images should primarily communicate the brand.
Here are some rules of thumb for designing your images:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Avoid text. </li>
  <li> Make sure your image works even when shrunk to half size. </li>
  <li> Assume the image will be on a light gray background. </li>
  <li> Use saturated colors if possible; they tend to work well. </li>
  <li> Avoid using a lot of white and light gray. </li>
  <li> Fill the entire region. </li>
  <li> Make sure the edges are well defined. </li>
</ul>

<p>
The following graphics are examples of the promotional images for an app:

<section id="newscreenshots">
<h2 id="screenshots"> Screenshots </h2>

<p>
You must provide at least 1&mdash;and
preferably the maximum allowed 5&mdash;screenshots of your app
to be displayed in the app's store listing.
If your app supports multiple locales,
you can provide locale-specific screenshots
as described in
<a href="i18n.html">Internationalizing Your App</a>.
</p>

<p>
When you edit your app's listing,
mousing over a screenshot's thumbnail brings up controls
that let you delete the screenshot or change its position.
</p>



<p>
Each screenshot should be as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Square corners, no padding (full bleed) </li>
    <li> 1280x800 or 640x400 pixels </li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
<b>Note</b>:
1280x800 screenshots are preferrable,
as larger screenshots look better on high-resolution displays.
Currently, all screenshots are downscaled to 640x400 pixels.
If your screenshots do not look good when downscaled
(for example, they have a lot of text)
or if 1280x800 is too big for your app
(for example, screenshots for a low-resolution game),
you can upload 640x400 screenshots.
</p>

<p>
As an example, here are five screenshot images for an app:
