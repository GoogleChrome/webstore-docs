Once you've <a href="/chrome/web-store/docs/publish">published</a> your app or extension, you
may be wondering how users will find and install your app. For users who browse
the Chrome Web Store and find your item, its a very easy one-click process to
install it. However, if a user is already on your site, it can be cumbersome for
them to complete the installation - they would need to navigate away from your
site to the store, complete the install process, and then return.
</p>

<p>
As of Google Chrome 15, you can initiate app and extensions installations
"inline" from your site. These apps and extensions are still hosted in the
Chrome Web Store, but users no longer have to leave your site to install them.

When users install the app, they will see an installation confirmation dialog
similar to the one pictured on right. Just like the dialog displayed when
installing directly from the Chrome Web Store, it lists all of the permissions
that your app or extension is requesting. Additionally, this dialog includes the
average Chrome Web Store rating and the number of users, giving users extra
 confidence about what they are about to install.

<h2 id="overview"> Overview </h2>

<p>Inline installation is composed of two parts: a declarative
<code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag and a call to the JavaScript function
<code>chrome.webstore.install()</code>. In addition, you must also verify
an association between the site that triggers inline installation and
the relevant item(s) in the Chrome Web Store.</p>

<h2 id="cws-link"> Adding a Chrome Web Store link </h2>

<p>The HTML page on your site from which you want inline installation to occur
must contain one or more <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags in the
<code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section referencing the items
that the user can install. Each <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag must have
the following format:</p>

<pre>&lt;link rel="chrome-webstore-item" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/<i>itemID</i>"&gt;</pre>

<p>The URL in the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag must be
exactly as specified above, except that you should replace
<code><i>itemID</i></code> with the actual ID value for your item.
To determine the ID value for a specific item, go to the
<a target="_blank"
href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard">Chrome Developer Dashboard</a>
and click the name of the relevant app or extension. The ID value for that
item will be shown in the browser address bar; it is a string of
32 Latin characters at the end of the URL in the address bar.
Do not use the URL in the address bar as the URL in the
<code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag (the URL in the address bar uses
a new format that includes the app name &ndash; this new format does not work
for inline installation). Instead, copy the ID value from the URL in the
address bar and paste the ID value into the URL specified in the
<code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag above.</p>

<p>As an example, the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag for the
<a target="_blank"
href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apdfllckaahabafndbhieahigkjlhalf">Google Drive</a>
app would look like this:</p>

<pre>&lt;link rel="chrome-webstore-item"
    href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apdfllckaahabafndbhieahigkjlhalf"&gt;</pre>

<h2 id="triggering"> Triggering inline installation </h2>

<p>To actually begin inline installation, the
<code>chrome.webstore.install(<i>url</i>, <i>successCallback</i>,
<i>failureCallback</i>)</code> function must be called. This function
can only be called in response to a user gesture, for example within a click event
handler; an exception will be thrown if it is not. The function can have the
following parameters:</p>

<dt><var>url</var> (<span class="optional">optional</span> string)</dt>
<dd>
  If you have more than one <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag on your page with the
  <code>chrome-webstore-item</code> relation, you can choose which item you'd
  like to install by passing in its URL here. If it is omitted, then the first
  (or only) link will be used. An exception will be thrown if the passed in URL
  does not exist on the page.
</dd>

<dt><var>successCallback</var> (<span class="optional">optional</span> function)</dt>
<dd>
  This function is invoked when inline installation successfully completes
  (after the dialog is shown and the user agrees to add the item to Chrome).
  You may wish to use this to hide the user interface element that prompted the
  user to install the app or extension.
</dd>

<dt><var>failureCallback</var> (<span class="optional">optional</span> function)</dt>
<dd>
  This function is invoked when inline installation does not successfully
  complete. Possible reasons for this include the user canceling the dialog, the
  linked item not being found in the store, or the install being initiated from
  a non-verified site. The callback is given a failure detail string as a
  parameter. You may wish to inspect or log that string for debugging purposes,
  but you should not rely on specific strings being passed back.
</dd>

<h2 id="ui"> User interface elements for inline installation  </h2>

<p>One of the key concepts behind inline installation is that it allows you,
the app developer, to choose when to prompt the user to install the app or
extension. If the item is critical to your site, you may wish to have a modal
dialog or other distinctive noticeable user interface element for prompting
the user. If the item only provides secondary functionality, inline installation
may be hidden away on a secondary page of your site.</p>

<p>Since inline installation has to be triggered via a user gesture (for
example, a mouse click) it is therefore suggested that you tie the action to a
clickable user interface element such as a button. It is suggested that you use
the same button label as the Chrome Web Store itself (in English, this is "Add
to Chrome").</p>

<h2 id="already-installed"> Checking if an item is already installed </h2>

<p>You may wish to only show user interface elements that prompt the user to
install the item if it's not already installed.</p>

<p>To check if an app is already installed, you can use the
<a href="/chrome/web-store/faq#faq-app-24">
<code>chrome.app.isInstalled</code></a> property. By querying it from a page
contained within your app's
<a href="/chrome/apps/docs/developers_guide#manifest">URLs</a>, you can show
or hide interface elements as appropriate. For example:</p>

<pre>
&lt;button onclick="chrome.webstore.install()" id="install-button"&gt;Add to Chrome&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
if (chrome.app.isInstalled) {
  document.getElementById('install-button').style.display = 'none';
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>Extensions can
<a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/content_scripts.html#host-page-communication">communicate</a>
with the embedding page via content scripts to let it know that they are
already installed. For example, you could have a content script that targets
the installation page:</p>

<pre>
var isInstalledNode = document.createElement('div');
isInstalledNode.id = 'extension-is-installed';
document.body.appendChild(isInstalledNode);
</pre>

<p>Then your installation page can check for the presence of that DOM node, which
signals that the extension is already installed:</p>

<pre>
&lt;button onclick="chrome.webstore.install()" id="install-button"&gt;Add to Chrome&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
if (document.getElementById('extension-is-installed')) {
  document.getElementById('install-button').style.display = 'none';
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<h2 id="verified-site"> Verified site requirement </h2>

<p>
  For security reasons, inline installations can only be initiated by a page on
  a site that is <a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=34592">verified</a>
  (via <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/">Webmaster Tools</a>) as being
  associated with that item in the Chrome Web Store. Note that if you verify
  ownership for a domain (for example, <code>http://example.com</code>) you can
  initiate inline installation from any subdomain or page (for example,
  <code>http://app.example.com</code> or
  <code>http://example.com/page.html</code>).
