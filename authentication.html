When a user installs and launches your app from the Chrome Web Store, odds are they’ll be signed in to their Google Account. If your app requires authentication, then you should significantly streamline the process for your users by supporting Federated Login to allow users to sign in to your app using their Google Accounts. In this article, we’ll cover some the basics of Federated Login using Google Accounts, things to consider when designing your authentication flow, some examples of apps that allow users to sign in using their Google Accounts, and resources to help you learn more and get started.

<h2 id="overview">
Overview of Federated Login
</h2>

<p>
Federated Login, based on the <a href="http://openid.net">OpenID</a> standard, frees users from having to set up separate account credentials for different web apps, and frees developers from the task of implementing login authentication measures. OpenID achieves this goal by providing a framework in which users can establish an account with an OpenID provider, such as Google, and use that account to sign in to any web app that accepts OpenIDs.
</p>

<p>
Google supports the OpenID 2.0 protocol, providing authentication support as an OpenID provider. A third-party site can request Google to authenticate users who are signing in with an existing Google Account. Google will return an identifier to the third-party site that the site can use to recognize the user. This identifier is uniquely identifies the user, enabling the third-party site to recognize the user across multiple sessions.
</p>

<h2 id="considerations">
Considerations
</h2>

<p>
When deciding how to structure the authentication flow for your app, keep the following considerations in mind.
</p>


<h4>Will you be adding support for Federated Login with Google Accounts on top of an existing authentication system?</h4>
<p>
If so, you can provide users a way to link their new accounts with their existing accounts. For more guidance and best practices for handling and linking legacy accounts, see <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/oauthgoog/UXFedLogin/loginlogic">this article</a>. In the <a href="#examples">Examples</a> section below, you'll see a walk through of the account creation process for Springpad, which gives the user the choice to link with an existing account or continue as a new user.
</p>

<h4>Do you you want to use a different authentication flow if your app is launched via the Google Chrome app launcher?</h4>
<p>
You can further streamline the process for users by supporting a different authentication flow when your app is launched via the Google Chrome app launcher as opposed to a bookmark or link. You can use JavaScript to check whether <code>window.chrome.app.isInstalled</code> is defined. If it is, the app is running from the Google Chrome app launcher, and you can assume they'll be signing in via their Google Account. Here's an example of the code you'd use:
<pre>if (window.chrome.app.isInstalled) {
  // You're running as an installed app, via the app launcher!
} else {
  // You're running via a bookmark or link.
}</pre>
</p>

<h4>Must users provide information in order to create a new account in your system?</h4>
<p>
With OpenID, you can request information such as first name, last name, email address, region, and language. You request this additional information by including <a href="/accounts/docs/OpenID#endpoint">attribute exchange parameters</a> in the authentication requests that you send to the Google OpenID endpoint. What if you require additional information such as settings related to your app, or if you require a user to accept your terms of service before creating an account? In those cases, you can prompt the user to provide additional information after they've opted to sign in with their Google Account. In the <a href="#examples">Examples</a> section below, you'll see a walk through of the account creation process for Manymoon, which demonstrates this process. If the extra information is optional, then you can also consider waiting until after a user has created their account to gather this information, in order to simplify the account creation process.
</p>

<h4>What authentication options will you present to your users?</h4>
<p>
The way you decide to design your user interface may be different if you only support Federated Login with Google Accounts versus supporting Federated Login with Google Accounts and your existing authentication system. See <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/oauthgoog/UXFedLogin">Usability Research on Federated Login</a> for more options.
</p>

<h4>Do you want to use a pop-up UI or a browser redirect flow for signing in?</h4>
<p>
You have a choice of how users will be prompted for their Google Account credentials. You can prompt them via a pop-up UI, or you can use a browser redirect flow. Our <a href="/chrome/web-store/docs/samples#php">PHP sample code</a> demonstrates how to use the pop-up UI, while the <a href="/chrome/web-store/docs/samples#java">Java</a> and <a href="/chrome/web-store/docs/samples#python">Python</a> sample code uses the browser redirect flow. To try the different styles of authentication yourself, see <a href="http://www.puffypoodles.com/">these examples</a>.
</p>

<h4>What if a user deletes their Google Account?</h4>
<p>
If a user deletes their Google Account, they can no longer sign in to your app using that account. In this case, you could provide a way of associating accounts in your system with a different OpenID identifier, similar to a password reset flow.

Examples
</h2>
<p>
The screencasts below show three different account creation and authentication scenarios from a user's perspective.
</p>


<h4>Basic authentication flow</h4>
<p>
This screencast uses the Diary.com app to demonstrate a basic authentication flow.

<h4>Requesting additional information during account creation</h4>
<p>
In this screencast, the Manymoon app demonstrates an account creation flow where the user is prompted for additional information.

<h4>Linking with an existing account</h4>
<p>
This screencast uses the Springpad app to show how a user can sign in to an app with their Google Account and then link to an existing Springpad account.

Resources and Best Practices
</h2>

<p>
This section has some final tips about terminology, federated identity, and where you can get more information.
</p>

<p>
For consistency with Google Accounts, we recommend using the following terms to
refer to account creation and authentication:
<ul>
  <li><strong>sign in</strong></li>
  <li><strong>sign out</strong></li>
  <li><strong>create</strong></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong>
The adjective and noun forms of the first two terms are <em>sign-in</em> and <em>sign-out</em>. Also note that the user <em>signs in to</em> an account (that's three words).
</p>

<p>
When a user is creating an account in your app, we recommend displaying a splash page to the user before prompting them to sign in to their Google Account. Displaying a splash page provides context to the user about why they're being asked to sign in to their Google Account. The Springpad app in the <a href="#examples">Examples</a> section above demonstrates one possible layout for a splash page. See <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/oauthgoog/UXFedLogin">Usability Research on Federated Login</a> for more options.
</p>

<p>
Make sure you're using the correct federated identity URL when you request the <a href="/accounts/docs/OpenID#endpoint">OpenID endpoint</a>. The URL you should use to get the Google OpenID endpoint is <code>https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id</code>.
